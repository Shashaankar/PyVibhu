PyVibhu is aimed to build a private cloud platform that can be deployed anywhere, anytime if the underling device is capable of hosting, disseminating data among various devices for high availability, fault tolerance, seamless connectivity and consistency. Providing interfaces to rich set of applications in cloud and Internet of Things domain, mainly providing three main services:
1. Connectivity
2. Data storage
3. Data processing/mining

PyVibhu is more kind of a connectivity subsystem, initially targeted to provide provide a ftp like service on Linux/Unix like systems. More details of the library/application will be described in architecture and design documents.  

Future components:
PyRibhu - private cloud module/subsystem handling data processng and data mining based on requirements of applications.
PyVaja - private cloud susbsystem handling data storage, maintaining repositories

From Atharvaveda it is learnt that Sudhanvan Angirasa had three sons, Ribhu, Vibhu and Vaja, collectively known as Ribhus who were intelligent sages. They carried the luminous power of knowledge to this world, which knowledge pervaded the world as nectar. Ribhu or Ribhukshan was skillful at handling knowledge; Vibhu or Vibhawa was skillful in pervading and diffusing, and Vaja handled embodied plenitude with similar skill; all three dwelled in the solar-region and are considered to be the rays of the sun. They are the three leaders of rites and the possessors of opulence, and the three deities of several Rig Vedic hymns.
